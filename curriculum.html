    </div>
    <p class="pwidth">As an  experienced educator, I have a deep-seated passion for inspiring young minds. My expertise spans a wide range of coding languages and platforms, from creating websites using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to developing games with Unity and C#. I have expertise in teaching Scratch, a platform that I've used to introduce children to the fundamentals of programming. A significant part of my teaching experience involves instructing coding in traditional classroom settings, allowing me to foster an engaging and interactive learning environment. Academically, I hold a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), equipping me with a strong theoretical foundation to guide my practical teaching approach. My mission is to ignite curiosity, encourage creativity, and build confidence in my students as they navigate the exciting world of coding.</p>
